            "cerebral palsy is a nonprogressive central nervous system disorder that results in physical impairments and functional limitations that change as the children grow older . among a large number of instruments [ 24 ] , for measuring the physical ability of children with cp , the gross motor function classification system ( gmfcs ) introduced by palisano et al . in 1997   has been widely applied in clinical and research settings . \n",
            " the gmfcs is a five - level classification system that identifies abilities and functional limitations , based on the need of assistive devices of the cerebral palsy child , during self - initiated movements , such as walking and sitting . \n",
            " the system application is quick and easy and it gives a brief description of which level the child resembles based on his / her current gross motor function . \n",
            " the reliability and validity of the gmfcs in differentiating cerebral palsy children with different functional levels have been reported . \n",
            " similarly , the stability of the system over time proved to be very consistent , suggesting that the gmfcs could be used routinely in clinical practice to follow children with cerebral palsy . \n",
            " however , due to the heterogeneous nature of cerebral palsy , some overlap between levels i and ii has been observed and , indeed , anticipated by the authors [ 2 , 5 , 7 ] . \n",
            " gmfcs level i is associated with children with persistent neuromotor abnormalities not as severe as children from level ii . \n",
            " overlap between levels occurred more often when deciding if a child has limitations walking outdoors , going up stairs , jumping , or running . \n",
            " many studies aimed to determine which outcome tools could assist clinicians and researchers to improve the classification levels i and ii of the gmfcs [ 1 , 4 , 8 ] . \n",
            " correct classification at clinical settings has been corroborated by tests such as the gmfm-66 , gait velocity , and the weefim mobility [ 8 , 9 ] . \n",
            " child with cerebral palsy often develops changes in muscle length over time , more common at the hip and knee flexors and at the ankle dorsiflexors [ 10 , 11 ] . \n",
            " kilgour and colleagues ( 2005 ) using passive range of motion tests reported that diplegic children levels i and ii of the gmfcs had minimal loss of hip extension compared to a matched control group . since the gmfcs classification is based on functional activities , it would be more interesting to obtain measurements during dynamic activities . \n",
            " in addition , it is expected that muscle shortness is more advanced in diplegic children level ii than level i of the gmfcs \n",
            " . therefore , range of motion comparison between levels i and ii is also relevant . \n",
            " these muscles changes might affect the range and amplitude of the lower limb during dynamic activities such as gait . \n",
            " however , to date , none of the studies tried to discriminate gmfcs levels i and ii according to the angular displacement of the pelvis , hip , knee , and ankle / foot complex during gait . \n",
            " instrumented gait analysis is a complex procedure and a highly costly diagnostic tool ; however , the kinematic data obtained provides quantitative information on gait abnormalities that can not be detected during visual observation . \n",
            " raising the knowledge of the gait biomechanical differences between child with cerebral palsy level i and ii of the gmfcs can improve observational gait analysis skills and , at the same time , improve classification accuracy and more coherent physical therapy approaches based on the functional status of children with cerebral palsy . \n",
            " therefore , the research questions for this study were : ( 1 ) are there differences in the kinematics gait profiles of the pelvis and lower limb joints during gait between diplegic cerebral palsy children classified as gmfcs levels i and ii ? ( 2 ) if differences in the kinematics were found , which ones would be the most discriminatory between these groups ? \n",
            " a cross - sectional observational study was conducted with diplegic cerebral palsy children classified by a trained physical therapist , as gmfcs levels i and ii . \n",
            " the intra - rater reliability of the physical therapist in assessing the gmfcs levels was excellent ( icc = 0.941 ) . \n",

            " prior to participation , all procedures were explained to the child and his / her parent or guardian and an informed written consent was obtained . \n",
            " twenty - two ( 22 ) diplegic cerebral palsy children were included in the study , 15 male and 7 females between the ages of 7 and 12 , who could ambulate independently without assistive devices for a minimum of 6 meters without resting . \n",

            " characteristics of the participants , such as age ( years ) , height ( m ) , and body mass index ( bmi , kg / m ) , were obtained in order to describe the anthropometrics of the groups . \n",
            " three - dimensional kinematics of the right lower limb ( hip , knee , and ankle / foot joints ) and pelvis during the stance phase of the gait cycle were obtained with a six camera motion analysis system ( motion capture unit - qualisys medical ab 411 12 , gothenburg , sweden ) . \n",

            " the resulting data were processed through the visual 3d motion analysis software ( c - motion , inc , rockville , maryland ) where the rigid segments corresponding to the pelvis , shank , thigh , and ankle / foot segments were first created . \n",
            " the position of the reflective anatomical markers were used for attributing coordinate systems for each segment and were located at left and right iliac crest , left and right greater trochanter , medial and lateral epicondyle of the femur , medial and lateral malleoli , 1st and 5th head of the metatarsus , and calcaneal tuberosity . \n",
            " one rigid cluster with 4 noncollinear markers was placed at the base of the sacrum and two nonrigid clusters with 3 noncollinear markers were placed at the medial side of the thigh and shank . \n",

            " were as follows : ( 1 ) flexion of the hip and knee , anterior tilt of the pelvis , and ankle dorsiflexion , all of which occur about the lateral - medial or x - axis and were positive angles ; ( 2 ) adduction of the hip and knee , pelvic obliquity ( meaning the height of the iliac crest of the stance foot higher in relation to the height of the iliac crest of the opposite foot ) and internal rotation of the ankle / foot complex , all of which occur about the anterior - posterior or y - axis and were considered positive angles ; ( 3 ) internal rotation of the pelvis , hip and knee joints and adduction of the ankle / foot complex occurs about the distal - proximal or z - axis and all were positive angles . gait velocity ( m / s ) , stride length ( m ) , and cycle time ( s ) for the entire gait cycle , and swing and stance time ( s ) , were also obtained . \n",

            " difference between children of gmfcs levels i and ii included limitations in walking outdoors and in the community , on uneven surfaces , and in crowded places . \n",
            " children of level ii may hold onto a rail to climb stairs , may require wheeled mobility when traveling long distances , and their ability to perform gross motor skills such as running and jumping are minimal compared to children in level i . \n",
            " studies showing disagreement between levels i and ii have been reported , suggesting difficulty in classifying if a child has functional limitation or can perform gross motor skills [ 5 , 7 ] . during normal gait strike , the hemipelvis of the stance limb is aligned with the contralateral hemipelvis . at the beginning of loading response and mid - stance , the contralateral hemipelvis drops in the frontal plane , and the stance hemipelvis is higher around 4 to 7 . \n",
            " the effect of pelvic drop is to adjust the length of the support lower limb , helped by some degree of knee flexion , avoiding excessive lower vertical displacement of the center of mass . \n",
            " the hip abduction / adduction displacement at this moment is dependent on the pelvis movement over the femur . while hemipelvis elevation favors adduction of the stance limb , hemipelvis drop favors , on the contralateral side , hip abduction movement . \n",
            " besides saving body energy by preventing greater inferior displacement of the center of mass , hip adduction of the stance limb , also shifts the body center of mass towards the center of rotation of the hip being loaded . \n",
            " the result would be a decrease in the external adductor moment of force , favoring the mechanical advantage of the hip abductor muscles during stance . \n",
            " the summation of these actions prevents excessive pelvic drop and the trendelenburg gait . as well , when the support limb begins terminal stance and preswing phases , the opposite will occur . \n",
            " the pelvis will begin to drop , favoring hip abduction which is important to assist the release of the foot from the ground , permitting the body to swing forward [ 22 , 24 ] . \n",
            " therefore , pelvic obliquity and hip adduction are two mechanisms that work synchronously to maintain stability and forward movement of the body . in diplegic children with cerebral palsy , \n",
            " reduced pelvic obliquity could be a result of abductor muscles weakness bilaterally and adductor muscles spasticity . \n",
            " another explanation could be that , by reducing pelvic elevation on the supported limb in the stance phase of the cycle , children with cerebral palsy are probably trying to decrease leg length to facilitate the next initial contact of the same foot . \n",
            " however , this strategy would increase inferior displacement of the center of mass cycle , resulting in a less efficient gait [ 25 , 27 ] . at the hip joint , \n",
            " reduced hip adduction in the stance phase increases the internal abductor moment of the support limb . since children with cerebral palsy normally show weakness of the hip abductor muscles , the gait pattern would be unstable , forcing them to increase base of support or to spend less time in the unipodal phase [ 14 , 22 ] . \n",
            " the decreased hip adduction could also be a response to alterations in pelvic obliquity , once the loaded hemipelvis is lower than normal , challenging the hip mechanics to generate hip adduction . \n",
            " the combination of reduced pelvic obliquity and hip adduction during the stance phase of the gait cycle , reinforce the evidence that children with cerebral palsy gmfcs level ii are more unstable during gait compared to children in level i. in threatening situations , such as walking on uneven or inclined surfaces , the greater instability of children in gmfcs level ii could justify their need for assistive devices . \n",
            " it also justifies their use a rail to walk up and down stairs , since reduced pelvic obliquity would decrease hip abduction that could also affect hip flexion . although the kinematic analysis was not a tool used to assist the development of gmfcs classification system , the findings of the present study support the differences between levels i and ii of the gmfcs , recently revised by the authors . \n",
            " the discriminant model revealed that pelvic obliquity has a higher impact in discriminating children gmfcs level i from those of level ii . \n",
            " clinically , this result shows that pelvic obliquity in the frontal plane explains better the mechanical difference between children in level i and ii . \n",
            " the importance of pelvic obliquity during gait was introduced in 1953 by saunders and coworkers   as one of the most important gait marker that minimizes the vertical displacement of the center of mass . in 2001 \n",
            " , della croce   and coworkers confirmed that pelvic obliquity and single support knee flexion are the second most important gait determinants in reducing center of mass dislocation and consequently improving gait efficiency . \n",
            " the present study demonstrated that gait velocity was similar between cp children in level i and ii . \n",
            " in a multicentre study conducted with 562 children with cerebral palsy , classified in levels i to iii of the gmfcs , determined that gait velocity is a discriminant factor between levels i and ii . similar results were reported by oeffinger et al . . \n",
            " in addition , damiano and abel   reported that the temporal and spatial parameters were important indicators of the severity level of the cerebral palsy children . \n",
            " the classification in levels i and ii , proposed by palisano et al . , was based primarily in the limitation of the child to execute movements that involved velocity and stability , such as walking , jumping , and going up and down stairs . \n",
            " therefore , we would expect a significant difference between levels i and ii in the gait spatial and temporal markers . \n",
            " it is likely that the different instruments used to capture temporal and spatial gait markers and the fact that our sample was composed only of diplegic cerebral palsy children probably justify the different results found in the present study . \n",
            " gait alterations in children with cerebral palsy may also occur in other planes of motion . \n",
            " rodda and graham   proposed a classification system for diplegic children based on the kinematic and kinetic analyses focused in the sagittal plane . \n",
            " however , the authors agreed that important alterations may also occur in the frontal and transverse planes . \n",
            " for example , excessive internal pelvic rotation during initial contact contributes to a higher range of hip abduction motion observed during gait strike . on the other hand , \n",
            " increased pelvic obliquity may be secondary to a decrease in the hip and knee sagittal motions . \n",
            " the lack of significant findings in the sagittal plane could be related to the nature of the movement . as in the sagittal plane , \n",
            " the range of motion is greater compared to the other planes , the variability is normally smaller when compared to movements with smaller range of motions [ 33 , 34 ] . \n",
            " one option would be to increase the sample size , in an attempt to identify the subtle variances that could occur in the sagittal plane . \n",
            " nevertheless , in the present study , even with a relatively small sample size the results could discriminate the groups , showing that , in fact , a difference between levels i and ii , although subtle , could be detected with the multivariate analysis technique applied . \n",
            " the present study offers new information on angular displacement in all three planes of gait stance of children with cerebral palsy classified as gmfcs levels i and ii . clinical observation of reduced pelvic obliquity and hip adduction during gait is a difficult task . \n",
            " the literature on observational gait analysis has shown that training and experience are important for a more consistent observation of the pelvic and hip movements during gait . therefore , the kinematic idiosyncrasy of each gmfcs level could be added as one important clinical parameter to help the classification process of mild - to - moderate children with diplegia . \n",
            " in addition , prior knowledge of the biomechanical differences between gmfcs levels i and ii may guide further physical therapy strategies , focused on regaining pelvic obliquity and hip adduction range of motion of the support limb . such strategies may promote gait stability of cerebral palsy children level ii , with less energy expenditure and free from assistive devices .\n"
